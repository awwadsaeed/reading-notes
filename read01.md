choosing a text editor 
basically, all text editors are the same in essence the difference is some features here and there. 
there are text editors that come with the computer but they are the bare minimum of what we look for in text editors as they lack the desired features as code completion and syntax highlighting. thus we look for third party text editors such as visual studio code, atom and BB edit.

the command line
a command line or CL for short is a text based interface to the system.
you are able to enter commands by typing them on the keyboard and feedback will be given to you similarly as text.
there are commands for navigation, creating new directories and creating files and much more.
it might be hard to learn it first but it has more features than GUI and will become easy to use with time so its worth the effort.
