- **What does SQL stand for?** 
Structured Query Language.  
- **What is a realational database?**  
A relational database is a form of database which stores and allows access to connected data elements. The relationship data base is based on the relationship model "There has been a mistake.  
- **What type of structure does a relational database work with?**  
Relational databases are based on the relational model, an intuitive, straightforward way of representing data in tables.  
- **What is a ‘schema’?**  
Schema is a framework or paradigm for the organization and interpretation of information.  
- **What is a NoSQL database?**  
NoSQL databases (aka “not only SQL”) are non tabular, and store data differently than relational tables. NoSQL databases come in a variety of types based on their data model.    
- **What is inside of a Mongo database?**  
Every mongod instance has its own local database, which stores data used in the replication process, and other instance-specific data. The local database is invisible to replication: collections in the local database are not replicated.  
- **Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.**  
MongoDB is versatile rather than SQL. MongoDB is more flexible than SQL. NoSQL databases don't have the reliability functions which Relational Databases have.  
- **What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?**  
Less mature and Less support.  

- **What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?**  
SQL databases are good fit for the complex query intensive environment.  
- **Give a real world example.  **
SQL database examples: MySql, Oracle, Sqlite, Postgres and MS-SQL.  
- **What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?**  
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data.  
- **Give a real world example.**  
NoSQL database examples: MongoDB, BigTable, Redis, RavenDb, Cassandra, Hbase, Neo4j and CouchDb.  
- **Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?**  
NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage.  
- **Which type of database is best for scalability?**  
SQL databases are vertically scalable, But NoSQL are horizontally scalable.
