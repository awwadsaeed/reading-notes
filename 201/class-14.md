# why some groups perfom better than others
in an article made on a study google made called Project Aristotle there was question if there were 2 teams which of these teams would you rather be in.  
team A who is all time profetional in meetings they stay on course and when someone speaks out another reminds him to stay on course and after the meeting ends they all leave to thier respective desks.  
Or team B who is easy going all can speak and when one stray away form the subject the others stray away with him and when the meeting ends it never really ended and they stay to talk about thier personal lives.   
the study showed one would be better off in team B based on some factors:
- a friendly invironment is more likley to be better at communications and sharing info
- a better working invironment where every one is open about other's ideas is more likely to find mistakes and better solutions 
- individual bonds matter at work as anywhere else 
- overambition never works, it fuels fued between members who vie for the same spot.

in my honest openion a perfect team should have both mindsets be open to other ideas but also act with profetionalisim talk and listen to others. share ideas and also think of others thought of thiers. there is always advantages and disadvantages to almost all solutions, seeing many ideas and applying the solution in a profitional manner is what enables us to get the most out of the situation. but then agian humans are unpredictiable and perfect isn't attainable otherwise we wont be chasing it.
