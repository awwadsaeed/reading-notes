# Objects and the DOM
## Objects  
objects are a bunch of data related to something or each other grouped togather to be manipulated better.  
in objects variables become attributes and functions becom methods.  
they are accesed using the dot (.) operator.  
the object are written as following:  
`const objectName {
    name : 'saeed',
    age : 25,

    getName: function(){
        consol.log('name');
    }  
}`  
  
# DOM  
the DOM stands for document object model. the document is just the web page weather it was the rendered one or the html code. as for the objects every html elemnt is an object wether it was the body, main, p, ul and li. the model is like a tree representation of the objects in the document it views them as nodes it also views the attributes and the text inside the tags as nodes as well.  
we use the DOM inside the javascript code to access the html tags and thiers content so we can add remove or modify them, thier attributes and/or thier content.
