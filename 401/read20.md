# Component Based UI
## Review, Research, and Discussion  
### Name 5 Javascript UI Frameworks (other than React)?  
- Angular  
- Vue.js  
- jQuery  
- Backbone.js  
- Polymer  
### Whatâ€™s the difference between a framework and a library?  
The technical difference lies in a term called inversion of control. When you use a library you are in charge of the flow of the application ( you are choosing when and where to call the library), but when you use a framework it is in charge of the flow (provides some places for you to plug in your code but it calls the code you plugged in as needed.  
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms  
- Rendering: is the process of displaying something on a screen.  
- Templates: ready to use parts of code.
- State:  an object of a set of observable properties that control the behavior of the component.  
## Preview  
- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?  
  * templates  
  * libraries  
  * state 
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?  
  * hooks  
  * a better way to set state  
  * nothing comes to mind yet  
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?  
    mostly hooks.

### what is JSX?  
JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript. It allows us to directly write HTML in React (within JavaScript code). It is easy to create a template using JSX in React, but it is not a simple template language instead it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
