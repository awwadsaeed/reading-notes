## Document the following Vocabulary Terms  
cookies are small blocks of data created by a web server while a user is browsing a website and placed on the user’s computer or other device by the user’s web browser. Cookies are placed on the device used to access a website, and more than one cookie may be placed on a user’s device during a session.  

authorization is the function of specifying access rights/privileges to resources, which is related to general information security and computer security, and to access control in particular.  

access control is the selective restriction of access to a place or other resource, while access management describes the process. The act of accessing may mean consuming, entering, or using. Permission to access a resource is called authorization.  

conditional rendering is a term to describe the ability to render different user interface (UI) markup if a condition is true or false.  
## Application State with Redux  
What are the advantages of storing tokens in “Cookies” vs “Local Storage”?

**Fundamentals of Redux Course from Dan Abramov**  

Redux provides a solid, stable, and mature solution to managing state in your React application. Through a handful of small, useful patterns, Redux can transform your application from a total mess of confusing and scattered state, into a delightfully organized, easy to understand modern JavaScript powerhouse.  

The principles of Redux aren’t new, but they are packaged and presented for you in an easy to use a library that not only elevates your applications but also improves your general understanding of building JavaScript UIs.  

In this course, Dan Abramov will show you the fundamentals of Redux, so that you can start using it to simplify your applications.  

This is a comprehensive (but simplified) guide for absolute Redux beginners, or any who wants to re-evaluate their understanding of the fundamental Redux concepts.
