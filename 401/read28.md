# Redux - Combined Reducers
## Review, Research, and Discussion  
- **Why choose Redux instead of the Context API for global state?**
Context API is great for small applications where state changes are minimal but Redux is better for large applications where there are many changes to state. Redux also offer time-travel and single source of truth for state.  
To manage huge applications with complex state management, in a large scale application, Redux is a better way to control state.

- **What is the purpose of a reducer?**  
The reducer takes a state and an action and returns a new state  
- **What does an action contain?**  
Object literals that tell the reducer what is being done to the app, and any data required for the update.  
- **Why do we need to copy the state in a reducer?**  
Reducers are not allowed to modify the existing state, instead they must make immutable updates by copying the existing state and making changes to the copied values.  
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms  
- immutable state: This allows the state to only change when absolutely necessary to make React apps perform as well as possible.  

- time travel in redux: This is a feature of redux dev tools that allows you to see every state that a page has been in.  

- action creator: Actions send data from your application to your store, and are the only source of information for the store. An action creator is a function that creates an action.  

- reducer: Reducers tell the application how to change state in response to an action.  

- dispatch: This is the name of the function you use to send actions to the store.  
## Preperation material  
combineReducers:  
helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore . The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object  

As your app grows more complex, youâ€™ll want to split your reducing function into separate functions, each managing independent parts of the state  

The combineReducers helper function turns an object whose values are different reducing functions into a single reducing function you can pass to createStore  

The resulting reducer calls every child reducer, and gathers their results into a single state object. The state produced by combineReducers() namespaces the states of each reducer under their keys as passed to combineReducers()
