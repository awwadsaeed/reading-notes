# Data Modeling
## Data Modeling


1. **Name 3 advantages to Test Driven Development?**

  - *better program design and higher code quality*
  - *reduces the time required for project development*
  - *Code flexibility and easier maintenance*


2. **In what case would you need to use beforeEach() or afterEach() in a test suite?**

    If you have some work you need to do repeatedly for many tests, you can use beforeEach and afterEach.


3. **What is one downside of Test Driven Development?**  

    Tests got to be maintained when requirements change

4. **Whatâ€™s the primary difference between ES6 Classes and Constructor/Prototype Classes?**  

    a class defines a type which can be instantiated at runtime, whereas a prototype is itself an object instance.

5. **Why REST?**   

    highly scalable, simple, and easy to modify and extend.

----

1. **Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?**  

    - REST
    - OOP
    - Jest

2. **Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?**  

    - Data model
    - TDD and CI/CD
    - non-relational Database

3. **What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?**  


   modeling data using non-relational database.

**SQL vs NoSQL Database Differences Explained with few Example DB**  
Most of you are already familiar with SQL database, and have a good knowledge on either MySQL, Oracle, or other SQL databases. In the last several years, NoSQL database is getting widely adopted to solve various business problems.

**object-oriented programming (OOP):**   
is a computer programming model that organizes software design around data, or objects, rather than functions and logic.

**REST:**  a software architectural style which uses a subset of HTTP. It is commonly used to create interactive applications that use Web services. Data Model: is an abstract model that organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to the properties of real-world entities.
