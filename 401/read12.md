# Socket IO  
## Document the following Vocabulary Terms:  
- Observer Pattern: The observer pattern is a software design pattern in which an object, named the subject, maintains a list of its dependents, called observers, and notifies them automatically of any state changes, usually by calling one of their methods.  
Listener: function in a computer program that waits for an event to occur.  
Event Handler: is a block of code (usually a JavaScript function that you as a programmer create) that runs when the event fires. When such a block of code is defined to run in response to an event  

Event Driven Programming: An event-driven programming approach uses events to trigger various functions. An event can be anything, such as typing a key or clicking a mouse button. A call-back function is already registered with the element executes whenever an event is triggered.  

Event Loop: Event loops handle asynchronous callbacks in Node.js. It is the foundation of the non-blocking input/output in Node.js, making it one of the most important environmental features.  
Event Queue: An event queue is a repository where events from an application are held prior to being processed by a receiving program or system. Event queues are often used in the context of an enterprise messaging system.  
Call Stack: A call stack is a mechanism for an interpreter (like the JavaScript interpreter in a web browser) to keep track of its place in a script that calls multiple functions — what function is currently being run and what functions are called from within that function, etc.  
Emit/Raise/Trigger: initiating an event so that the listenter can execute the call back function.  

Subscribe: Subscribes an event handler method or procedure to an ABL or .NET class event.  

database: A database is an organized collection of structured information, or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. A database is usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).  
## Preview:  
- Which 3 things had you heard about previously and now have better clarity on?  
   everything in the preview was new to me.  
- Which 3 things are you hoping to learn more about in the upcoming lecture/demo?
    soket io, tcp and ios.  
- What are you most excited about trying to implement or see how it works?
    soket IO.  
## preparation materials:  
WebSocket : is a computer communications protocol, providing full-duplex communication channels over a single TCP connection. The WebSocket protocol was standardized by the IETF as RFC 6455 in 2011, and the WebSocket API in Web IDL is being standardized by the W3C.  

WebSocket is distinct from HTTP. Both protocols are located at layer 7 in the OSI model and depend on TCP at layer 4. Although they are different, RFC 6455 states that WebSocket “is designed to work over HTTP ports 443 and 80 as well as to support HTTP proxies and intermediaries,” thus making it compatible with HTTP. To achieve compatibility, the WebSocket handshake uses the HTTP Upgrade header to change from the HTTP protocol to the WebSocket protocol.  

Socket.IO enables real-time bidirectional event-based communication. It works on every platform, browser or device, focusing equally on reliability and speed. Socket.IO is built on top of the WebSockets API (Client side) and Node.js. It is one of the most depended upon library on npm (Node Package Manager).
